\# Drinks Info



\[The Drinks Info Project](https://thecsharpacademy.com/project/15/drinks) is a CSharpAcademy roadmap project that introduces you to using API's.



Developed with C# and Spectre Console.



\# Requirements:

\- :white\_check\_mark: You were hired by restaurant to create a solution for their drinks menu.

\- :white\_check\_mark: Their drinks menu is provided by an external company. All the data about the drinks is in the companies database, accessible through an API.

\- :white\_check\_mark: Your job is to create a system that allows the restaurant employee to pull data from any drink in the database.

\- :white\_check\_mark: You don't need SQL here, as you won't be operating the database. All you need is to create an user-friendly way to present the data to the users (the restaurant employees)

\- :white\_check\_mark: When the users open the application, they should be presented with the Drinks Category Menu and invited to choose a category. Then they'll have the chance to choose a drink and see information about it.

\- :white\_check\_mark: When the users visualise the drink detail, there shouldn't be any properties with empty values



\# Dependencies

\- Spectre.Console (0.50.0)



\# Features



\### :cocktail: Drink Details



Firstly select a drink category and then select the drink you'd like to view the recipe and instructions for. The detailed drink information will be output to a table. 



To select another drink simply press any key to return to the drink category selection.



\# Learning Outcome

\- I need to better understand how to structure my application architecture to work with APIs (e.g., properly seperating logic from views). 

\- JSON property attributes are really helpful for renaming properties while still mapping the JSON response.

\- Overriding the string.ToString() method is extremely helpful especially when working with Spectre Console and menu selections.

\- Naming models is hard when they're closely related.
